      !                     Structural Design pattern
      ?     Controls access to an object
     * Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object
      *The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object.
     * Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients.
     * Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.
     * Provides a substitute for another object and controls access to that object allowing you to perform
    *  something before or after the request reaches the original object
    ! Proxies usually manage the full lifecycle of their service object
