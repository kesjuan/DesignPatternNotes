    //Singleton pattern Ensures that a class has just a single instance, provides a global access point to this instance

    //  object created with singleton can never be overwritten
    // Implementations have two steps in common
    //1. Make the default constructor Private to prevent other objects from using the "new" operator with the singleton class
    //2. Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor.
    // All calls to this method return the cached object
